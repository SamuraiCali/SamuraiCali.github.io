    <p>Golf's history is intertwined with the natural world. From its Scottish origins in the 15th century to its growth across the globe, golf courses have always been designed to complement the landscape. As environmentally conscious golfers, we should draw inspiration from this heritage. Recognize that the golf courses you play on are not just backdrops, but vibrant ecosystems that deserve respect and protection.</p>

    <h2>Hitting it off</h2>
    <p>Back in the ‘60s and ‘70s, people known as golf superintendents had no formal recruiting process or curriculum to follow, and in the discovery for “how professional are” by Stanley Metsker, it was evidently ‘not very much’. This is when, despite controversy, the GCSAA unveiled a certification program that forced superintendents to focus on turfgrass science, new equipment, plant-protectant chemicals, and the business side of golf course management.</p>

    <p>There would be reexamination every 5 years and mandatory workshop correspondence. In the years that followed over 4000 members by 1976 had been certified members. In the 80s a shift towards “responsible golf” was brought to the forefront from all these educated members and is still a practice used today as an articulated set of best practices for course management as a golfer. In the first edition of Golf Course Management from 1980, Gary Bethune a CGCS (Certified golf course superintendent) said 
        <blockquote class ="pullout-quote">
<p> “Apathy and complacency are the greatest threats to our profession. One of The most important task we  have as  managers is  maintaining  a  high  degree  of  Expertise and interest in each segment of our responsibilities.  This ability and interest level are directly proportional to the amount of effort we devote to acquiring knowledge relating to our profession. So, if we want to grow professionally, we must be willing to learn.”</p>
</blockquote>

        a quote that can still be put to great use today. In the 90s the GCSAA produced a television program “Par for the Course” which aired highlights of course management and provided a platform for positive environmental messages on Sunday mornings on ESPN. This all culminated in a message that golf was trying to send out into the world during this era that A, Golf is a boon to the environment, through trying to say they were water-friendly. B, a boon to the economy, by stating they provide thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in property taxes that couldn’t be refuted. C. Golf is in good hands with capable and experienced CGCS and D. Golf representatives are champions of the environmental movement. By providing services that are environmentally and economically beneficial, golf was positioned as neither an enemy nor a bystander in the environmental movement, but environmental leader. A case in point is the Environmental Leadership Awards which began in 1991. The man who had first questioned how professional golf was about environmentalism and found the answer to be ‘not really' in the 60s now cosigned his approval of golf work in the 90s saying 
        “It is clear that GCSAA is well on the road to professionalization for golf course Superintendents and recognition for its members.  It  is  not  a  process  that  can happen overnight, but the prospects are bright for our profession moving up the ladder of success”</p>
